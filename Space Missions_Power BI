# Space Mission dashboard




The dashboard is created based on the Maven's Space mission dataset, which is available on the Maven's Data playground. 
The Space Mission dashboard was developed based on FP20 Analytics Data Challenges, Challenge 3. The challenge was to remake the 
most popular report in NovyPro by Federico Pastor on space missions.
